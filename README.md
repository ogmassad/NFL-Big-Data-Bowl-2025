## Identifying Defensive Backs Blitzing Tendencies
- Olivia Massad's Project Submission for the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl.
## Data
- All data is included in the Release.
- Data is the same in the Release as it appears on the NFL Big Data Bowl Website.
- All data cleaning is included in `main.R`.
## Code
- `main.R` includes all code relating to cleaning the data, model training and prediction, hypotheses tests, and plots.
## Description
- This code identifies the most important tendencies of defensive backs in the NFL for predicting when they are going to blitz. The code contains hypotheses tests to compare means, a trained logistic regression model, confidence intervals for means, and two plots using real game data.
## Assumptions
- In this model it is assumed that defensive setup, yards to go, and downs do not affect the pre-snap tendencies of players when they blitz.
